            "text": "Merchant Navy\u2019s Top 6 Lessons for Machine Learning\n\nThe scale at which they operate can teach you a lot about designing your ML Pipelines\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to talk to Capt. Ravi Budhwar, a captain works in the Merchant Navy. Captain Budhwar has spent many years on the seas and is an expert in all the intricacies of Maritime Trade and Shiping. He has also won awards throughout his career. Talking to him was very insightful because as a land dweller, it can be easy to forget about Shipping. However, this is a crucial industry. In fact, the global merchant fleet in 2020 shipped 2 Billion Deadweight Tons. Without shipping, modern supply chains would not exist.\n\nCapt. SSS Rewari award is given to the best cadet of their batch. Captain Ravi won it during his Pre sea training days\n\nAs Captain Ravi explained the scale of the shipping industry, I was surprised. A middle-sized ship can weigh up to over 90,000 tons and is on the water constantly for months on end. The crew onboard has to encounter challenges such as rough weather, constantly changing seascape, 24 hour navigation, changing time zones. If the ship has problems mid-voyage, repairs can be challenging. Most impressive is how they can manage all this with small crews (the average size of the crew on these ships is between 20 and 30).\n\nThis is a mid-sized ship. Imagine the size of the large cargo ships. Much smaller cruise ships have crews numbering in the 100s\n\nThe conversation about the scale of his operations and the efficiency of his crew had me very interested in the systems that made this possible. I wanted to know how the ships and the industry had created systems to solve such complex problems. The ships have several fantastic lessons in organization and pipeline design that we can use for our Machine Learning Systems. I will go over the ones I found most interesting.\n\nClearly Defined Responsibility + Priorities\n\nOne of the most striking features of a ship is that every member of the crew knows exactly what they have to do. Each crew member is allocated a specific shift, and their duties are written down in painstaking detail. This extends even to emergency responsibilities. The high level of detail has many benefits. The most obvious is in cases of emergencies, where instead of wasting time, the crew can spring into action immediately.\n\nMost self-help gurus preach about the benefits of a routine. On the ship, this is taken to the next level\n\nEven on the most mundane days, this plays a crucial role. Since everyone knows exactly what they need to do at different times, there is very little time wasted in idling. The tasks are done like clockwork, in a timely and effective manner. This also leads to increased accountability. If a task isn\u2019t done, the crew knows exactly who was responsible and this makes diagnosing the problem much faster.\n\nEvery officer has sections dedicated to their roles\n\nThis is something that a lot of organizations could use. In my experience, the management often has half-baked ideas for projects. A lot of time is wasted in retrieving datasets (no one knows which ones will be relevant), ironing out the details with stakeholders, and redoing entire segments because requirements suddenly change. I once spent a whole week waiting to learn what I had to do. A more clearly defined and rigorous division of labor with clearly defined roles and responsibilities would serve companies/organizations well.\n\nDocumentation\n\nLeading off the last point, I noticed that the Merchant Navy is \u2026a little extreme about documenting things. Every day, all the happenings and weather conditions are recorded in a logbook. Aside from this, the crew compiles all the work done in the day and sends a presentation to the captain. There are separate weekly and monthly reports aside from this.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to get lost in one of these. Photo by Ian Taylor on Unsplash\n\nThis is still somewhat sane. The navy, however, is slightly neurotic about the documentation. Every door is labeled. You can tell what room you\u2019ll enter, before even entering it. The elevators have a directory of all the floors, so you can figure out which floor you need to go to. There are huge files to keep note of every little decision made on the ship.\n\nI will do a whole article on Documentation, make sure you\u2019re following me to catch that\n\nFortunately, we don\u2019t have to be this militant to avail of the benefits. Sensible documentation covering the projects, the data sources used, features selected and dropped, protocols used, etc are enough. Unfortunately, most firms (including big names) need to invest a lot more into the documentation aspect. Otherwise, there is a lot of time wasted redoing procedures and tests already completed by the previous team. This is time spent reinventing the wheel. Some upfront investment in documentation will save tons more resources in the future.\n\nPlanned Maintenance System\n\nLooking at the scale of the ships, I was curious about one thing: \u201cHow do you stop things from breaking?\u201d This is especially important for ships. Remember each of these ships is at sea, where repairs in case of problems are not easy. The size of these giants also means that dragging them from deep waters would be a challenge (cargo ships easily dwarf Aircraft Carriers). And there\u2019s the cost. A delay by a day can cause a loss of Millions of Dollars.\n\nSome number from the Ever Given fiasco. Taken from BBC News: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56559073\n\nThere is a safety issue as well. Failure of ships in the deep sea can cause serious danger to the safety of the crew. Based on the cargo, it will also adversely impact the marine biology of the surrounding area. Thus there is no margin for error.\n\nThe pistons used in the ships are much bigger than people. Pistons used by large cars can be held by you.\n\nSo how does the crew of 20 maintain a ship of thousands of tons, intricately designed with thousands of pipes, drains, and other moving parts? Especially when some of these parts are bigger than the crew themselves (the engine in these ships is bigger than most houses). As a tech person, I was expecting tons of high-tech monitoring systems and AI monitoring. The solution was much simpler.\n\nPMS is literally a lifesaver\n\nWhile the team does have tons of monitoring equipment, the secret lies in the proactive approach taken by the crew. Instead of waiting for signs that something is wrong, the team instead does regular checks of the parts, regardless of functioning. These checks, called Planned Maintenance Systems are planned well in advance. The precise division of labor allows the crew to work fast and check equipment much bigger than they are. PMS allows for long-distance shipping to be safe and cost-effective.\n\nTo quote a cliche, prevention is better than cure. This holds true for Machine Learning as well. That is why integrating multiple error metrics, and monitoring for data drift is crucial in your own projects. These steps are ignored by most people\n\nRedundancy\n\nSafety is the first priority for all sailors. This shows itself in various ways, from Stop Works (any crew member can stop their work if they find it unsafe) to the insistence on extreme attention to detail. The most glaring example of this is the redundancy built into the ships.\n\nRadars are crucial to ships. This is why ships have multiple backup radars. Photo by Ibrahim Boran on Unsplash\n\nOver long distances, errors in one degree can throw you off course by thousands of miles. This is why the ships have multiple radars that are in use at any moment. Crew members use the readings from all of these to fine-tune their navigations. They also have different kinds of compasses, and of all else fails, tools to navigate using the stars.\n\nEach ship also has 2 lifeboats. The total capacity of these lifeboats is mandated (by international law) to be 200% of the ship's capacity. In case of power failure, the ship has multiple generators (and backups to them).\n\nThe number of people who miss this is shocking.\n\nHow can you apply this to Machine Learning? First thing: cross-validate everything. Any time you use an ML model, you need to use cross-validation with it. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s effective, and it is seriously underutilized. After that, start trying to test for different occurrences. Machine Learning is quite fragile and you should never call it quits after one configuration. The article, Why You Need to Spend More Time Evaluating your Machine Learning Models presents more details about how seemingly arbitrary decisions in setting up your Deep Learning/AI models can significantly skew the results.\n\nAlong with integrating randomness and variance into your data, using a more diverse set of evaluation protocols will also allow your models to have a more diverse \u201cperspective\u201d. Writing better Machine Learning evaluation protocols (Regression) gives the code skeleton you could use.\n\nWords from a Wise Man\n\nWhile it may be tempting to rush towards testing models, make sure you cover your bases first. A good model might improve your performance 5%, but if you have to retrain and rebuild constantly, your system will lose money. It\u2019s not sexy to spend a lot of time on tons, and cross-validation/multiple splits, but it is crucial.\n\nMoney lies in scale\n\nWe have spent a lot of time talking about how big the shipping industry is. The world would not exist if not for the existence of large-scale shipping. The size and scale of these ships make them very valuable. Filled with cargo, a medium-sized ship is worth over a Billion Dollars. There are 20 countries with a lower GDP than one of these ships. This is also reflected in the compensation of the crew.\n\nRemember, when the crew is on the ship, they have no expenses. The salary is their take-home monthly\n\nWhen you\u2019re trying to work in Machine Learning, remember this. Your solutions won\u2019t be truly valuable till they can operate at scale. When I was working with ICICI Bank, our dataset added 10 million samples every day. My work with ForeOptics was on a global scale (supply chain analysis). Johns Hopkins University required me to evaluate the health policy of an entire state.\n\nThe reason I was able to do well in ICICI Bank is that I built a solution that the bank could use at scale\n\nThe reason I stress robustness, generalization, and cost-effectiveness is precisely this. Google can afford to sink 10,000 training hours on multiple servers. Your group can\u2019t.\n\nA captain can do everything (doctor, navigation, etc etc)\n\nThis was probably the most surprising aspect. Captain Ravi told me that the ship captains also double up as Medical Professionals, Navigators, and whatever else is needed. They have the authority to sign off on birth, death, and marriage certifications. They also have to deal with customs and port authorities. They have ultimate authority (and responsibility) over the ship. If one of the crew members has any kind of problem (including technical issues), the captain steps in for them.\n\nMaster is another word for captain. A captain has to oversee all the aspects of the ship\n\nTo do their job well, Captains must be able to do everything well. This makes captains like Capt. Ravi real-life heros, masters of multiple skills. It allows Captains to not only step in when needed but also truly understand the challenges faced by their crew. A well-rounded skill set also allows captains to truly anticipate problems and be proactive in creating solutions.\n\nThis backs up what I\u2019m saying. Too many managers don\u2019t know enough\n\nThis approach works very well in tech. There is often a huge disconnect between management and developers, which leads to unreasonable expectations and very unclear instructions. There are only losers in such an arrangement. A manager with technical skills in a large scope of the project will be much better for leading. This doesn\u2019t even require expertise in the domains, just a solid understanding.\n\nMy understanding of Web Development and Automation helped me scrape the web for ForeOptics.\n\nThis applies to you on a personal level as well. The more you know about different ideas, the better you will be at solving problems. Even though I specialize in Machine Learning, I have exposure to Android Development (JavaScript and Kotlin), Web Dev (JS, React, Python), Functional Programming (Haskell), and Server Side Programming (Java). This has helped me with my Machine Learning since I can take greater agency and try out more things in my projects.\n\nProgramming is a must for Machine Learning. Get good at Python and learn 2\u20133 other languages\n\nThis is also why I talk about the importance of Math, Programming, and Computer Science fundamentals in my article, How to learn Machine Learning in 2022. All of these will give you perspectives that crucial to ML (Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Artificial Intelligence are intersections of these fields).

            "title": "Hands-On Guide To Detect Objects In Video In 5 Steps",
            "text": "Object detection techniques are a trend nowadays in the field of computer vision. There are many techniques which are used to detect objects in the scene images and videos. Each of these techniques has its own advantages and limitations in terms of resources and execution time. Detecting objects in videos also requires a lot of technical knowledge and resources.\n\nSo, there is always a search for an easy and quick method for object detection. In this article, we will show how to detect objects seen in the videos in only 5 steps. We will use the pixellib library in this task which detects objects using instance segmentation. We will also use the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to identify the objects seen in the videos. In this implementation, we will detect vehicle objects in traffic video.\n\nInstance Segmentation\n\nInstance segmentation is a technique in computer vision that is used in object detection using image segmentation method. It identifies each instance of the objects present in the images or videos at the pixel level. In image segmentation, the visual input is splitted into segments to represent the object or part of objects by forming a collection of pixels. Instance segmentation identifies each instance of each object featured in the image instead of categorizing each pixel like in semantic segmentation.\n\nMask R-CNN\n\nMask R-CNN is a variant of Deep Neural Network proposed by Kaiming He et al at Facebook AI Research. This model is used to solve the object instance segmentation problem in computer vision. It detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. It is an extension of Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation is given below.\n\n(Image Source: Original Research Paper)\n\nImplementation\n\nNow, we will discuss the steps through which we will detect the objects in a video.\n\n1. Install library and dependencies\n\nIn the first step, we need to install the pixellib library and its dependencies.\n\n!\n\n\n\npip install pixellib\n\n2. Load pre-trained Mask-RCNN weights\n\nAs we are going to use the Mas R-CNN model to detect objects, we will download its pre-trained weights.\n\n! wget --quiet https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2 .0 /mask_rcnn_coco.h5\n\n3. Import libraries\n\nNow, we will import the pixellib library that has been installed. We will also import the instance_segmentation class because we are going to detect objects using instance segmentation method.\n\nimport pixellib\n\nfrom pixellib.instance import instance_segmentation\n\n4. Instantiate instance segmentation model and load Mask-RCNN weights\n\nIn this step, we will instantiate the instance segmentation class that is provided by pixellib and load the Mask R-CNN model with its pre-trained weights.\n\nsegment_video = instance_segmentation()\n\nsegment_video.load_model( \"mask_rcnn_coco.h5\" )\n\n5. Detect objects\n\nIn this step, we will process the object detection task by Mask R-CNN in a video. A random traffic video is used in which we want to detect vehicle objects.\n\nTraffic Video\n\nIn this method, we set the frames per second that are the number of frames per second output video will have.\n\nsegment_video.process_video( \"traffic_vid2.mp4\" , show_bboxes = True , frames_per_second= 15 , output_video_name= \"object_detect.mp4\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we will get the output video in the working directory. The time in this process depends on the lengths and size of the video. You should use a GPU for faster processing speed. For the above traffic video, we have got the following video in the out having detected objects.\n\nYou can define a function to get the videos from YouTube and pass them directly to the function above. So, using the above steps, we could discuss a very easy way to implement the task of object detection in videos. A person with very less knowledge of deep learning and computer vision can be able to detect objects using this way.",
